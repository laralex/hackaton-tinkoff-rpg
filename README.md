Only `bot.py` file contains a very simple working demo Telegram bot, which is now capable of giving an entry poll to a user. From this poll we can then assign an in-game Role to the user (e.g. Traveler or Businessman or Naturalist etc). Other files in repository are draft for integrating an inventory as shown in Figma prototype, though we didn't manage to make it work in time
